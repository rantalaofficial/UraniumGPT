This is a minimalistic ChatGPT GUI wrapper that utilizes OpenAI API. It is made using PyQt5 for the GUI and OpenAi official library for the API connection. It has all the functionality needed for basic LLM use: support for multiple chats, text streaming and model selection.

## How to use?

1. Make a file named "API_KEY" to the same folder as main.py and paste your OpenAI API key inside. 

2. Install OpenAI and PyQt5 python libraries:

`pip3 install --upgrade openai`

`pip3 install PyQt5`

3. Launch the app!

`python3 main.py`
