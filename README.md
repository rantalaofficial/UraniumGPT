This is my own ChatGPT GUI wrapper made using PyQt5 and OpenAi libraries

## How to use?

1. Make a file named "API_KEY" to the same folder as main.py and paste your OpenAI API key inside. 

2. Install OpenAI and PyQt5 python libraries:

`pip3 install --upgrade openai`

`pip3 install PyQt5`

3. Launch the app!

`python3 main.py`

## Screenshot from the app:
