This is my minimalistic ChatGPT GUI wrapper made using PyQt5 and OpenAi libraries. It has all the functionality needed for basic LLM use: support for multiple chats, text streaming and model selection.

## How to use?

1. Make a file named "API_KEY" to the same folder as main.py and paste your OpenAI API key inside. 

2. Install OpenAI and PyQt5 python libraries:

`pip3 install --upgrade openai`

`pip3 install PyQt5`

3. Launch the app!

`python3 main.py`
